# Cohort-Analysis-Bike-Data
The Dataset was about the location of different pickups in latitude and longitude and we have to do cohort analysis on weekly basis
Further I have applied Kmean Clustering onto the data and to find the clusters for the pickup mapped them on a map using the latitude and longitude of the location.
hyperparameter tuning was done to find the right K
